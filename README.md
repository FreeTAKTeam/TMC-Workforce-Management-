# ODA Component: Workforce Management

## **Overview:**
THis repository contains a demonstrator of an ODA component.
The Workforce Management (WFM) component within the Open Digital Architecture (ODA) framework is designed to optimize the management of an organization's human resources. It integrates various functionalities essential for efficient workforce planning, scheduling, and performance management, ensuring that the right people are in the right place at the right time, and their efforts align with the strategic goals of the enterprise.

## **Key Features**
### Business
1. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Ensures optimal assignment of employees to tasks based on their skills, availability, and business requirements.
   - Supports dynamic reallocation in response to changing demands and priorities.

2. **Scheduling and Rostering:**
   - Automates the creation of work schedules, considering employee preferences, availability, and labor laws.
   - Provides real-time adjustments and notifications to handle unexpected absences or changes in workload.

3. **Time and Attendance:**
   - Tracks employee attendance, hours worked, overtime, and leave.
   - Integrates with payroll systems to ensure accurate and timely compensation.

4. **Performance Management:**
   - Monitors and evaluates employee performance through key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
   - Supports continuous feedback, goal setting, and performance reviews to foster employee development and engagement.

5. **Compliance and Reporting:**
   - Ensures adherence to labor laws, union agreements, and internal policies.
   - Provides comprehensive reporting and analytics to support decision-making and strategic planning.

6. **Training and Development:**
   - Identifies skill gaps and facilitates employee training and development programs.
   - Tracks progress and effectiveness of training initiatives.


7. **Manage Field Workforce (MFW):**
   - Manages the lifecycle of work assignments or work orders carried out by the workforce.
   - Includes managing workforce staff (employees, contractors, consultants) directly or indirectly employed by the enterprise.
   - Manages work assignment queues, staff lists, individual work assignments, fast-track and jeopardy re-assignment capabilities.
   - Handles appointment schedules, work orders, forecasting staffing requirements, and work activity time estimates.
   - Establishes recall capabilities for out-of-hours staff recall.
   - Manages registration and access control processes for scheduling and work assignment data.
   - Ensures accurate capture and recording of all assignment and work scheduling details.
   - Tracks and monitors usage and access to the MFW system and associated costs.

 ### Technology 
1. **Model-Driven Component Derived from ODA as a Model:**
The Workforce Management component is inherently model-driven, deriving its structure and functionalities from the Open Digital Architecture (ODA) as a Model. This approach ensures that the component is fully aligned with the standardized frameworks and best practices established by the TM Forum. By leveraging the ODA model, the Workforce Management component integrates seamlessly with other ODA components, providing a consistent and interoperable solution that enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of workforce management processes. The model-driven nature of this component ensures that it is adaptable and scalable, capable of evolving alongside organizational needs and technological advancements.

2. **Supporting Technology: DigitalPy**
The Workforce Management component is implemented on the top of DigitalPy, am open source framework designed to support  digital engineering within the Python programming language. DigitalPy, developed by the FreeTAKTeam, provides the necessary tools and libraries to build, deploy, and manage digital solutions effectively. By utilizing DigitalPy, the Workforce Management component benefits from a flexible foundation that enables efficient handling of distributed, scalable applications. This framework supports various digital engineering concepts, ensuring that the code cam be managed from a model. More information on DigitalPy can be found at [DigitalPy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/DigitalPy).


3. **API Integration:**
   - ODA components Utilize OpenAPIs for seamless integration with other enterprise systems.
   - Ensures data consistency and real-time information flow across the organization.
